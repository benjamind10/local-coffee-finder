AS A Coffee Enthusiast

I WANT to be able to get the locations that sell coffee around my location

SO THAT I can retrieve information about the cafe such as rating, phone number and address

I WANT to be able to try different coffees and generate random coffee description

SO THAT I can try and make them at home or try it next time at a store
